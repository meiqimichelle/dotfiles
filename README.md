# dotfiles
A place to keep personal dotfile settings files so I don't keep loosing them. Link to these from my home directory. 

And don't forget:
- To get home, click your heels together three times and type `~/`. 
- To open this file, you can always `open .zshrc` for example.
- You've been using [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) lately with [oh my zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)
